Problem Statement
A cook needs a way to make cooking decisions when they have loved ones who
have different food preferences, to reduce cooking time,
and to prepare one meal instead of two.

Solution 
Create an online application that a user can be able to enter an ingredient thay have and they will be able to get the 
various types of food they can make from any cuisine and they will be able to get a list of ingredients required
to make the meal and the steps on how to make it.
